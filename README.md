# Marksheet Extractor - Python Flask Application

This application is designed to extract text from marksheets (image or PDF format) and process it to retrieve relevant information like student details, course names, and grades. It utilizes Flask for building the web interface and various libraries for image processing and text extraction.

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.7 or later (download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- pip (package installer for Python, usually included with Python)

## Installation Instructions:

### Linux/macOS:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Install Python and pip, if not already present (refer to Python's download page for specific instructions).
3. Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies (recommended, but optional):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv my_env
   source my_env/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
   ```
4. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Windows:

1. Download and install Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (ensure "Add Python 3.x to PATH" is checked during installation).
2. Open a command prompt window.
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended, but optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv my_env
   my_env\Scripts\activate.bat  # Activate the virtual environment
   ```
4. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application:

(Specific instructions will depend on your application's structure. Here's a general example.)

1. Make sure you're in the directory containing your Flask application's main Python file (often named `app.py`).
2. Run the application using `flask run`:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
3. This will start the Flask development server, usually accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

## Additional Notes:

- **pytesseract Dependencies:** pytesseract requires additional downloads for specific languages to improve accuracy. Follow the instructions on the pytesseract project page ([invalid URL removed]) to set up language support.
- **Flask App Structure:** The specific structure of your Flask application will determine how to interact with it. This guide provides a general overview of running a Flask application.

## requirements.txt

Here's the content you need to create a separate file named `requirements.txt` in the same directory as your README.md:

```
Flask==2.2.3  # Core web framework
Werkzeug==2.2.3  # Dependency for Flask (included in Flask installation)
pytesseract==0.0.9  # Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library
Pillow==9.4.0  # Image processing library
pdf2image==0.19.5  # PDF to image conversion library
pandas==1.5.2  # Data analysis and manipulation library (optional for CSV output)
matplotlib==3.6.2  # Visualization library (optional for CSV output)
```

Remember to replace `my_env` with the name you choose for your virtual environment (if using one).
